Below is a BASIC outline of the restful api.

xml/json: response type
all methods use post which must contain at least: username "username" and password(hashed?)"password"; return "unauthorized" if failed to login

GET/
  hello:
    returns: hello
    just a fully implemented example, will be removed later
  fileList:
    returns: list of stored files(images)
  file:
    input: filename "filename"
    returns: base63 encoded file, "file not found", "invalid arguments"
PUT/
  file:
    * Input: _FILE['file']
    * Return: "Success" | "Invalid file type" | "Error movinvg file" | "File is too large" | "Error uploading"
  password:

  user:

Example:
a post with only the user info to the following url=restful/get/hello will return:
.json: {"code":1,"status":200,"data":"Hello World"}

.xml:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<response>
	<code>1</code>
	<data>Hello World</data>
</response>
